# create admin user inside container

After successfully starting your gvm docker container you need to create an admin user account to start playing with gvm11. The new password setup is optional, you can stick to the autogenerated one from the create user process if you like.

```bash
if [ $(su - gvmd -c "gvmd --get-users | grep admin | wc -l") == 0 ]; then
  su - gvmd -c "gvmd --create-user=admin --role=Admin"
  su - gvmd -c "gvmd --user=admin --new-password=<NEW-PASSWORD>"
fi
```

# adjust default scanner socket 

```bash
  su - gvmd -c "gvmd --modify-scanner=08b69003-5fc2-4037-a479-93b440211c73 --scanner-host=/tmp/ospd.sock"
```

# entropy

If the services in the container will not start, it could be related to available entropy. On linux you can check using:

```bash
cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail
```

If the output is not a four digit number you could install rng-tools and include: in `/etc/default/rng-tools`:

```bash
HRNGDEVICE=/dev/urandom
```

in `/etc/default/rng-tools`.
